_“Prefer a full component restart to internal failure handling.”_

In chapter 7 of the book we discuss principled failure handling, noting that the
internal recovery mechanisms of each component are limited because they are not
sufficiently separated from the failing parts—everything within a component can
be affected by a failure. This is especially true for hardware failures that
take down the component as a whole, but it is also true for corrupted state
that is the result of some programming error only observable in rare
circumstances. For this reason, it is necessary to delegate failure handling to
a supervisor instead of attempting to solve it within the component.

This principle is also called crash-only software: the idea is that transient
but rare failures are often costly to diagnose and fix, making it preferable to
recover a working system by rebooting parts of it. This hierarchical
restart-based failure handling makes it possible to greatly simplify the
failure model and at the same time leads to a more robust system that even has
a chance to survive failures that were entirely unforeseen.
