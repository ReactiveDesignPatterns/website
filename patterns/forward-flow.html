# Forward flow

_“Let the information and the messages flow directly toward their destination where possible.”_

This pattern sounds intuitive, maybe even trivial: why would you deliberately
send messages via detours when that is not required? The answer is that this
rarely occurs consciously; it is the result of applying a convenient,
well-known pattern overeagerly. The pattern in question is your good friend the
Request-Response pattern, with or without the Ask pattern’s sugar coating.
Overusing this pattern leads to unnecessary consumption of network bandwidth
and increased response latency; thinking about forward flow lets you recognize
these cases and improve your service quality.
