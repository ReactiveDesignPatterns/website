# Complex command

_“Send compound instructions to the resource to avoid excessive network usage.”_


You have encapsulated the resources your system uses in components that manage,
represent, and directly implement their functionality. This allows you to
confine responsibility not only for code-modularity reasons (chapter 6) but
also for vertical and horizontal scalability (chapters 4 and 5) and principled
failure handling (chapter 7). The price of all these advantages is that you
introduce a boundary between the resource and the rest of the system that can
only be crossed by asynchronous messaging. The Resource Loan pattern may help
to move a resource as close as possible to its users, but this barrier will
remain, leading to increased latency and, usually, decreased communication
bandwidth. The core of the Complex Command pattern lies in sending the behavior
to the resource in order to save time and network bandwidth in case of
loquacious interchanges between resource and users; the user of the resource is
only interested in the comparatively small result.
