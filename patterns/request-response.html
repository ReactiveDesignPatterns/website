  <title>Reactive Design Patterns — Request–response</title>

_“Include a return address in the message to receive a response.”_


This is the most basic interaction pattern we know; it is the foundational
building block for all natural communication, deeply ingrained in human
training. A parent will say something to their infant child, who will initially
gesture or make some sounds in response; later, the child will articulate words
and sentences. Request-response is the way you learn how to speak, and it
underlies all sophisticated forms of communication that you develop later.
Although the response can be nonverbal (in particular, facial expressions, but
also the deliberate absence thereof), in most cases you require a response
before successfully concluding a conversation. The response can be a piece of
information that you asked for or an acknowledgment of receipt for a command
that was given.

In all these cases, there is one commonality that you need to make explicit
when translating this basic means of communication into a programming pattern:
the process begins with two participants A and B, where A knows how to address
B; when receiving requests, B will need to learn or deduce how to address A in
order to send back a response.
