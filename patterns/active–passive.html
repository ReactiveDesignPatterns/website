# Active–passive replication

_“Keep multiple copies of the service running in different locations, but only accept modifications to the state in one location at any given time.”_

This pattern is also sometimes referred to as failover or master-slave
replication. You have already seen one particular form of failover: the ability
to restart a component means that after a failure, a new instance is created
and takes over functionality, like passing the baton from one runner to the
next. For a stateful service, the new instance accesses the same persistent
storage location as the previously failed one, recovering the state before the
crash and continuing from there. This works only as long as the persistent
storage is intact; if that fails, then restarting is not possible—the service
will forget all of its previous state and start from scratch. Imagine your web
shop forgetting about all registered users—that would be a catastrophe!
