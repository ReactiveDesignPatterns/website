  <title>Reactive Design Patterns — Managed blocking</title>
  <xmp style="display:none">
_“Blocking a resource requires consideration and ownership.”_

In the example code for how the execution component in the batch job service
provisions new worker nodes, you have already encountered the situation that an
API you are using is designed to block its calling thread. In the case of the
AWS API, there are ways around that, but this is not always the case. Many
libraries or frameworks that you may want to or have to use do not offer the
option of event-driven interaction. Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)  is a
well-known example that comes to mind. In order to use these APIs in a Reactive
system component, you need to take special care to properly manage the
resources that are implicitly seized, most notably the threads required for
their execution.
