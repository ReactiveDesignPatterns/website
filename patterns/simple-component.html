  <title>Reactive Design Patterns — Simple Component</title>
  <xmp style="display:none">
_“A component shall do only one thing, but do it in full.”_

This pattern applies wherever a system performs multiple functions or the
functions it performs are so complex that they need to be broken into different
components. An example is a text editor that includes spell checking: these are
two separate functions (editing can be done without spell checking, and
spelling can also be checked on the finished text and does not require editing
capabilities), but on the other hand, neither of these functions is trivial.

The Simple Component pattern derives from the single responsibility
principle that was formulated by Tom DeMarco in his 1979 book Structured
Analysis and System Specification (Prentice Hall). In its abstract form, it
demands to “maximize cohesion and minimize coupling.” Applied to
object-oriented software design, it is usually stated as follows: “A class
should have only one reason to change.”
