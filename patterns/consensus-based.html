_“Keep multiple copies of a service running in different locations, accept modifications everywhere, and disseminate all modifications among them.”_

Given a group of people, we have a basic understanding of what consensus means:
within the group, all members agree on a proposal and acknowledge that this
agreement is unanimous. From personal experience, we know that reaching
consensus is a process that can take quite a bit of time and coordination
effort, especially if the matter starts out as being contentious—in other
words, if initially there are multiple competing proposals, and the group must
decide which single one to support.
