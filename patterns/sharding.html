# Sharding

_“Scale out the management of a large number of domain objects by grouping them into shards based on unique and stable object properties.”_

The [Domain Object pattern](domain-object.html) gives you the ability to wrap
the domain’s state in small components that can, in principle, be distributed
easily across a cluster of network nodes in order to provide the resources for
representing even very large domains that cannot be held in memory by a single
machine. The difficulty then becomes how to address the individual domain
objects without having to maintain a directory that lists every object’s
location—such a directory could easily reach a size that is impractical to hold
in memory.

The Sharding pattern places an upper bound on the size of the directory by
grouping the domain objects into a configurable number of shards—the domain is
fractured algorithmically into pieces of manageable size. The term
algorithmically means the association between objects and shards is determined
by a fixed formula that can be evaluated whenever an object needs to be
located.
