  <title>Reactive Design Patterns — Circuit Breaker</title>
  <xmp style="display:none">
_“Protect services by breaking the connection to their users during prolonged failure conditions.”_

In previous patterns, we discussed how to segregate a system into a hierarchy
of components and subcomponents for the purpose of isolating responsibilities
and encapsulating failure domains. This pattern describes how to safely connect
different parts of the system so that failures do not spread uncontrollably
across them. Its origin lies in electrical engineering: in order to protect
electrical circuits from each other and introduce decoupled failure domains, a
technique was established of breaking the connection when the transmitted power
exceeds a given threshold.

Translated to a Reactive application, this means the flow of requests from one
component to the next may be broken up deliberately when the recipient is
overloaded or otherwise failing. Doing so serves two purposes: first, the
recipient gets some breathing room to recover from possible load-induced
failures; and second, the sender decides that requests will fail instead of
wasting time with waiting for negative replies.
